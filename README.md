# CKEditor 5 editor generated with the online builder

This repository presents a CKEditor 5 editor build generated by the [Online builder tool](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder)

---

Includes everything in ClassicEditor plus the following plugins:

- Underline (no, underline is not included by default)
- Alignment
- HorizontalLine
- ImageResize
- Font Size
- Font Family
- Font Color
- Font Background Color
- Highlight
- HTML embed

---

```
  toolbar: {
    items: [
      "heading",
      "|","bold", "italic", "underline", "fontColor",
      "|", "bulletedList", "numberedList", "indent", "outdent", "alignment",
      "|", "link", "imageUpload", "mediaEmbed", "insertTable", "blockQuote", "horizontalLine",
      "|", "undo", "redo", "htmlEmbed"
    ],
  },
```

---

Also includes a custom version of the header plugin: 

By default, ckeditor reserves `h1` for the `Title` plugin.  This build does not use `Title`, so instead the headers correspond to the correct numbers in their resulting `h` tags. 

TODO

- move the FirestoreUploadAdapter into this repo for future use
